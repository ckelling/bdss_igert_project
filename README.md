## Abstract: 
In order to understand the dynamics of crime in urban areas, it is
important to investigate the socio-demographic attributes of the
communities as well as the interactions between neighborhoods. If
there are strong social ties between two neighborhoods, they may
be more likely to transfer ideas, customs, and behaviors between
them. This implies that not only crime itself but also crime prevention
and interventions could be transferred along these social ties.
Most studies on crime rate inference use spatial statistical models
such as spatially weighted regression to take into account spatial
correlation between neighborhoods. However, in order to obtain a
more flexible model for how crime may be related across communities,
one must take into account social proximity in addition to
geographic proximity. In this paper, we develop techniques to combine
geographic and social proximity in spatial generalized linear
mixed models in order to estimate domestic and sexual violence
in Detroit, Michigan and Arlington County, Virginia. The analysis
relies on combining data from local and federal data sources such
as the Police Data Initiative and American Community Survey. By
comparing three types of CAR models, we conclude that adding
information on social proximity to spatial models, we create more
accurate estimation of crime in communities.
